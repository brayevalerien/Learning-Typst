# Learning Typst
[Typst](https://typst.app) is a new typesetting language with interesting capabilities for maths and computer science. It looks quite simple, with readable source code but many cool features. As a [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) user, I'm interesting in trying out this new language and see how it compares to [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) (and Markdown, my other markup language of choice for simple documents).

This repository contains the documents I write in order to get familiar with [Typst](https://typst.app). The content itself is not that important, it's just to demonstrate things, try the features, learn the language and produce my own examples I can refer to latter on.
